# Specify whether or not AIDE should be installed or removed.
#
# Note:
#   CIS Benchmarks specify that AIDE is to be installed. However,
#   AIDE requires a level of tuning that this role is not yet
#   prepared to handle.  It is for this reason that the default
#   is 'absent' and we'll accept the audit finding.

aide_state: 'absent'
